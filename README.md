# Hotel-management-data-analysis
This project is a complete data analysis workflow — from raw CSV data to actionable business insights — using a retail sales dataset (Superstore-style).   The objective is to understand  profit drivers, and customer trends to support data-driven decision-making.


1. Descriptive Analysis (What happened?)
Booking trends over time → number of bookings per month/season/year.
Cancellation analysis → percentage of bookings canceled, reasons for cancellation.
Occupancy rate → percentage of rooms occupied on specific dates or seasons.
Customer segmentation → domestic vs. international guests, business vs. leisure.

2. Diagnostic Analysis (Why did it happen?)
Cancellation causes → price change, booking lead time, customer type.
Revenue drop reasons → low demand season, overbooking, competition pricing.

3. Predictive Analysis (What might happen?)
Demand forecasting → predicting room bookings for upcoming months.
Price optimization → forecasting best pricing for maximum occupancy.
Cancellation prediction → using ML to detect high-risk cancellations.

4. Prescriptive Analysis (What should we do?)
Dynamic pricing → adjust prices based on demand, competitor rates, season.
Overbooking strategy → setting safe limits to avoid revenue loss.
Marketing optimization → targeting high-value customer groups.
